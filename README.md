### Project description

On the click of an IFTTT Do-button the Adafruit IO will receive the trigger and send a MQTT-message.
Which will be received by the Raspberry Pi. After the message display it will play an alert sound and flicker
the LED-matrix. When the joystick is pushed, the reaction time will be send to the Adafruit IO. IFTTT will
react to this and send an email.
